🎓 Student Success Prediction using Logistic Regression
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a student will Pass or Fail an exam based on multiple academic and lifestyle factors using Logistic Regression.
The model is built using Python and popular data science libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

The goal is to demonstrate a complete machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

🧠 Problem Statement

Educational institutions often want to identify students who may need academic support early.
This model predicts student success based on the following features:

🔢 Input Features (X)

Study Hours

Attendance (%)

Past Exam Score

Sleep Hours

🎯 Target Variable (Y)

Pass (1)

Fail (0)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

pandas – data handling and preprocessing

NumPy – numerical computations

matplotlib – data visualization

scikit-learn – machine learning model and evaluation

⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Feature selection

Data cleaning

2️⃣ Data Encoding

Encoding categorical target variable (Pass / Fail)

3️⃣ Feature Scaling

Standardization using StandardScaler

Ensures fair contribution of all features

4️⃣ Model Training

Logistic Regression (sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression)

Train-test split

5️⃣ Prediction

Predicting student result (Pass / Fail) on unseen data

6️⃣ Model Evaluation
